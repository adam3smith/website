I am the Director of the [Qualitative Data Repository](https://qdr.syr.edu), the Center for Qualitative and Multi-method Research (CQMI), and Research Associate Professor of political science at Syracuse University. I work on all aspects of the repository, but am particularly interested in data curation, the relationship between open science and qualitative research, and the development of scientific infrastructure and technology. I co-director the Institute for Qualitative and Multi-method Research (IQMR), which takes place every Summer in Syracuse. Currently I'm an associate editor of the _American Political Science Review_ and serve as the journal's data editor and ethics editor. 

As time permits, I am an active contributor to several scholarly open source software projects, including in particular [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), where I help oversee the site translators, and the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/), where I am on the board and co-maintain the style repository.
